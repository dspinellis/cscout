The data stored in the database allow the exact reconstitution
of the original source code.
All that is required is to run an appropriate query and filter
its results to recreate the original line breaks from irs output.
Elements modified in the database, such as identifier names or
comment contents, will be correctly mirrored in the generated output.
</p>
<p>
	The following is the required SQL query for the SQLite database
	to reconstitute the contents of the file with
	file identifier (<code>fid</code>) 4.
</p>
<!-- sql01-index.sql -->
<fmtcode ext="SQL">
.print "Starting dump"

SELECT s FROM (
  SELECT name AS s, foffset
    FROM ids
    INNER JOIN tokens ON ids.eid = tokens.eid
    WHERE fid = 4
  UNION SELECT code AS s, foffset FROM rest WHERE fid = 4
  UNION SELECT comment AS s, foffset FROM comments WHERE fid = 4
  UNION SELECT string AS s, foffset FROM strings WHERE fid = 4
  )
ORDER BY foffset;
</fmtcode>
<p>
The query's output needs to be pipped to the following commands
to adjust it as needed.
</p>
<fmtcode ext="sh">
# Remove header and footer lines
sed -e '1,/^Starting dump/d;/^[0-9][0-9]* rows/d' |

# Remove line breaks added by the database engine
tr -d '\n\r' |

# Add line breaks appearing in the database output as Unicode escapes
perl -pe 's/\\u0000d\\u0000a/\n/g;s/\\u0000a/\n/g' >test/chunk/$NAME
</fmtcode>
