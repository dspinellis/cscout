<em>CScout</em> can dump the relationships of
an entire workspace in the form of a SQL script.
This can then be uploaded into a relational database for further
querying and processing.
<p />
To generate the SQL script simply
run <em>CScout</em> with the switch <code>-s</code> <i>dialect</i>,
where the argument specifies the SQL dialect (for example,
mysql, or postgresql).
The SQL script will appear in <em>CScout</em>'s standard output,
allowing you to directly pipe the results into the database's
client.
For example, say the database you would want to create for your project
was called <code>myproj</code>.<br />
For MySQL you would write:
<fmtcode ext="sh">
(
	echo "create database myproj; use myproj ;"
	cscout -s mysql myproj.cs
) | mysql
</fmtcode>
For PostgreSQL you would write:
<fmtcode ext="sh">
createdb -U username myproj
cscout -s postgres myproj.cs | psql -U username myproj
</fmtcode>
For HSQLDB you would write:
<fmtcode ext="sh">
cscout -s hsqldb myproj.cs |
java -classpath $HSQLDBHOME/lib/hsqldb/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.util.SqlTool --rcfile $HSQLDBHOME/lib/hsqldb/sqltool.rc mem -
</fmtcode>

The direct piping allows you to avoid the overhead of creating an
intermediate file, which can be very large.
