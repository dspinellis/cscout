By default <em>CScout</em> only allows the local host (127.0.0.1)
to connect to your server for casual browsing.
<p>
To allow other hosts to connect <em>CScout</em> features an access control list.
The list is specified in a file called <code>acl</code> which
should be located in 
<code>$CSCOUT_HOME</code>,
<code>$HOME/.cscout</code>, or 
<code>.cscout</code> in the current directory.
The list contains lines with IP numeric addresses prefixed by an
<code>A</code> (allow)
or
<code>D</code> (deny)
prefix and a space.
Matching is performed by comparing a substring of a machine's IP address
against the specified access rule.
Thus an entry such as
<pre>
A 128.135.11.
</pre>
can be used to allow access from a whole subnet.
Unfortunatelly allowing access from the IP address
<code>192.168.1.1</code> will
also allow access 
<code>192.168.1.10</code>, <code>192.168.1.100</code>, and so on.

Allow and deny entries cannot be combined in a useful manner
since the rules followed are:
<ul>
<li> If the address matches an allowed entry the machine will be allowed access.
<li> If no allowed entries have been specified,
the machine will be allowed access unless it has been denied access.
(i.e. you can not use a deny entry to exclude a machine from an
allowed group)
</ul>
Thus you will either specify a restricted list of allowed hosts,
or allow access to the world, specifying a list of denied hosts.
