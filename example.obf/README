This directory allows you to run CScout on the "one true awk" source
code (6600 lines).  The code is almost vanilla ANSI C allowing CScout
to work with the supplied generic ANSI C headers.  Thus, your machine
does not need a C compiler installation, nor do you need to configure
the CScout setup files.  Having entered this directory on the unpacked
distribution tree just type:

../bin/cscout awk.cs (under Unix)

or

..\bin\cscout awk.cs (under Windows)

and you are off.

Note: If you have already moved the include file directory somewhere
else, and you have set CSCOUT_HOME accordingly, remove the .cscout
directory appearing here.



I downloaded the awk code from Brian Kernighan's home page
